# Gas Sensing Alert System

The Gas Sensing Alert System is a project designed to detect gas leakage in residential or industrial areas using a gas sensor, Arduino Uno, SIM900A GSM module, and a buzzer. Optionally, an ESP8266 module can be integrated for enhanced functionality. This README provides a comprehensive guide on the features, requirements, setup, and usage of the Gas Sensing Alert System.

## Features

### 1. Gas Leakage Detection

- The system utilizes a gas sensor to detect the presence of gas in the environment.

### 2. SMS and Call Alerts

- Upon detecting gas leakage, the Gas Sensing Alert System sends SMS alerts and initiates phone calls using the SIM900A GSM module to notify the home or industry owner.

### 3. Emergency Buzzer

- A buzzer is incorporated to emit an emergency alert sound, providing an immediate warning to individuals present in the area.

### 4. Optional ESP8266 Integration

- The system can be optionally enhanced by integrating an ESP8266 module for additional features such as remote monitoring and control.
